# pose-gen-deformable-gans
Implementation of the Research Paper - "Deformable GANs for Pose-based Human Image Generation" by Siarohin et al. 

Currently code is available for the project - 
1. By the original authors (But it used tensorflow) - https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/pose-gan
2. In pytorch - https://github.com/saurabhsharma1993/pose-transfer

PS - Currently training is converging to a vanishing gradient issue, with results showing change in pose - again only for certain poses, but the real issue being the bluriness of the results. 
TODO - Fix this entire thing.
